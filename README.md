# azure-weather-report
This project is a data engineering system that captures, processes, and analyzes weather conditions from anywhere in the world in real time. The end result is an interactive dashboard (for analysis) and an automatic alert system (via email) that warns of important weather events, such as storms or sudden temperature spikes.
